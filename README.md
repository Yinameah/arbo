# arbo

This is an attempt to write a mind mapping tool.
I named it after the french word "arborescence", which mean "tree structure".

I've no idea how far the project will go. For the time being, it's mostly a giant python coding experiment.

I'm not satisfied by existing software, and I need a tool with following specifications :
- Endless mind mapping surface
- Very simple and intuitive interface
- Images, drawings, text and link (internal or external) nodes
- Simple and efficient coloration tool
- Folding part of the tree
- Special thoughts for to do lists

And also :
- Android compatible app
- online synchronisation tool
